### **Project's purpose**
Hey guys! 
It's my first "real project" here in GitHub ^^
I'm doing this to understand better how Git/GitHub works and to improve my skills.
I'd be thankful if you help me to do this! :D

###  **About the project**

It's just a login system that I've made weeks ago but now I'm trying to send it to GitHub and improve it in the process.
If you have some question or suggestion about it, feel free to open an issue! :)
